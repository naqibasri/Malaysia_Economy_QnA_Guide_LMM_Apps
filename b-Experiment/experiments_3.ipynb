In this context, the last \\ntwo years of the implementation of the Twelfth Plan will be an important and critical point in ensuring continuous planning to accelerate \\ndevelopment by elevating the dignity of the nation and empowering the rakyat . It covers various areas, including economy, social and \\npolitics, which need to be adapted to the shared aspiration of Malaysia MADANI, a vision and direction encompassing aspects of justice, \\ndiversity, harmony, and progress.\\nThe remaining two years also offer opportunities for the Unity Government to undertake bold, proactive and innovative actions to embrace \\nthe aspiration of the rakyat  and face the challenges that have afflicted the country ever since. Hence, ‘Ekonomi MADANI: Memperkasa Rakyat’  \\noutlines a number of priorities and focuses on economic development that will certainly improve the wellbeing of the rakyat  and propel \\nMalaysia’s economy forward.\\nThrough this initiative, Malaysia strives to reach a higher level of development, in ensuring that every individual feels the positive impact of \\neconomic growth and social development. Therefore, the Mid-Term Review of the Twelfth Plan is an important pillar in the journey towards \\na more inclusive, dynamic, and competitive Malaysia, of which the interests and wellbeing of the rakyat  are given top priority.\\nIn order to accomplish this agenda, we are required to immediately take the necessary and important steps in developing Malaysia as a leader \\nin the Asian economy as well as emphasising the importance in improving the governance to restore confidence in the system and government.\\nIn the effort to become the leader of the Asian economy, we need to transform the economic structure, increase investment competitiveness \\nand expand the market to the ASEAN region. The source of economic growth will also be diversified by focusing on economic activities that \\nhave large spillover effects. Strengthening the competitiveness of local firms, from start-ups to listed companies, supported by a competitive \\ncapital market will be able to create more successful local companies.\\nSteps to reform and expand Islamic finance will be accelerated for Malaysia to be a leader in the global Islamic economy. In addition, micro \\nand small enterprises as well as the informal sector will be mainstreamed to generate higher income. Efforts to accelerate green growth in \\nensuring climate resilience and increasing productivity of the land use for food security will assure economic sustainability.\\nThe Government aim to improve the standard of living of the rakyat  will be realised through the provision of better social protection and \\ncomprehensive healthcare services, better employment opportunities, higher compensation of employees, reform of the education system and \\nhuman resource development as well as the provision of affordable housing. In addition, the provision of better facilities, including public transport, \\nwater and electricity supply as well as broadband services will pave more equitable opportunities to improve the quality of life of the rakyat .\\nThe Government also needs to regain the trust of the rakyat  by ensuring good governance in the national administration, public institutions \\nand upholding of democratic principles. Insaniah  values will be strengthened by upholding the principles of accoutability and aspects of \\nintegrity. These values should be enculturated by each and every rakyat  to support our noble commitment in building a new plan for Malaysia.\\nI would like to express my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude to all that have contributed ideas and efforts in the preparation of this \\nMid-Term Review of the Twelfth Plan. Numerous consultations have been held with various stakeholders, including ministries, agencies \\nand state governments as well as the private sector and MADANI civil society organisations to ensure that comprehensive strategies and \\ninitiatives are developed and implemented.\\nLet us together make a commitment to achieve the Mid-Term Review of the Twelfth Plan agenda with the theme ‘Malaysia MADANI: \\nSustainable, Prosperous, High-Income’ . Indeed, this initiative is not easy to be implemented. Insya-Allah , with utmost commitment from all \\nof us based on the Malaysia MADANI approach, success will definitely be ours.\\nANWAR IBRAHIM\\nPrime Minister\\nPutrajaya\\n11 September 2023', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\ksp_rmke_12.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Moving forward, the country needs to be more resilient in facing risks and uncertainties of the global economy besides \\naccelerating structural transition and narrowing socioeconomic development gaps. Therefore, it is imperative to review the policies and \\nstrategies of the Twelfth Plan in ensuring Malaysia remains on the growth trajectory.\\nThe framework of the MTR of the Twelfth Plan outlines strengthening efficiency of public service delivery as the key enabler. This will \\ninvolve efforts to improve governance, among others, include institutional framework as well as legislation related to corruption and rent-\\nseeking. The MTR of the Twelfth Plan also highlights three main focus, namely strengthening sustainability, building prosperous society \\nand achieving high-income nation. \\nA total of 17 Big Bold measures are introduced covering important strategies and initiatives that will serve as the main catalyst in accelerating \\nthe efforts to reform the socioeconomic development of the nation in line with the Malaysia MADANI aspiration. Among the Big Bold \\nmeasures include developing high growth high value (HGHV) industries, enhancing fiscal sustainability, retargetting subsidies, accelerating \\nenergy transition, advancing digitalisation and technology through GovTech as well as empowering micro, small and medium entreprises \\n(MSMEs). Meanwhile, reforming social protection, acculturating MADANI society, improving access to healthcare services, housing and public \\ntransportation as well as reforming labour market and wages towards ensuring future ready talent are also part of the Big Bold initiatives.\\nThe participation of all in preparing the MTR of the Twelfth Plan exemplifies the spirit of shared responsibility among the rakyat .

During the review period of  \\n2021-2022, Malaysia registered commendable socioeconomic development despite several \\nglobal and domestic challenges. Nevertheless, these challenges need to be addressed in \\nensuring the targeted outcomes are achieved. Thus, a review of targets, policies and strategies \\nof the Twelfth Plan is imperative in ensuring Malaysia remains on the right growth trajectory. \\nThe Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the Twelfth Plan, 2023-2025 encompasses revised policies \\nand strategies towards achieving the aspiration of ‘Ekonomi MADANI: Memperkasa Rakyat’ \\nthat will regain honour and dignity of the rakyat as well as building Malaysia as an advanced \\nand prosperous nation. The MTR of the Twelfth Plan is based on the theme ‘Sustainable, \\nProsperous, High-Income Nation’ . Enhancing efficiency of public service delivery is the key \\nenabler that will accelerate the implementation of three main focus areas, namely strengthening \\nsustainability, building a prosperous society and achieving a high-income nation. A total \\nof 17 Big Bolds are introduced as catalytic strategies in accelerating the move towards \\nachieving the targeted outcomes. The MTR of the Twelfth Plan document consists of eight \\nmain chapters, with a chapter on Overview as well as Beyond 2025 chapter as a prelude \\nto the Thirteenth Malaysia Plan, 2026-2030. The ultimate goal of the MTR of the Twelfth \\nPlan is to ensure that no one is left behind from reaping the benefits of socioeconomic \\ndevelopment and have equal access to opportunity in increasing the standard of living as \\nwell as in providing a bright future for generations to come, regardless of ethnicity, location, \\ngender and socioeconomic background.', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\ksp_rmke_12.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

Private investment \\nincreased by 4.9% per annum supported by acquisition of machinery \\nand equipment (M&E). Labour market conditions improved, leading to \\nhigher productivity growth of 3.7% per annum, with unemployment \\nrate at 3.9% in 2022. Meanwhile, average inflation rate increased to \\n2.9% per annum. In terms of external trade, gross exports grew by \\n25.5% per annum driven by an increase in demand for the electrical \\nand electronic (E&E), petroleum and chemical products. Gross imports \\nexpanded by 27.1% per annum on account of continuous demand for \\nintermediate, capital and consumption goods. The current account \\nremained in surplus at RM55.1 billion or 3.2% to gross national income \\n(GNI) in 2022, supported by substantial goods surplus. The Federal \\nGovernment fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP narrowed from 6.2% \\nin 2020 to 5.6% in 2022. Meanwhile, GNI per capita was higher at \\nRM52,968 (US$12,035) in 2022 from RM42,838 (US$10,191) in 2020. \\nThe wellbeing of the rakyat , as reflected by the Malaysian Wellbeing \\nIndex (MyWI) in 2021, also improved in line with the economic progress. Efforts to strengthen economic resilience through the implementation \\nof various measures were hampered by headwinds emanating from \\nglobal and domestic fronts. Global challenges include geopolitical \\ntensions, global trade and supply chain disruptions as well as higher \\ncommodity prices and inflation. Meanwhile, domestic issues include \\nslow structural economic transition, continued growth disparity between \\nregions and states, and limited fiscal space. In the remaining Twelfth \\nPlan period, measures will be undertaken to address these persistent \\nissues in boosting the economic growth.\\nReview of Themes and Policy Enablers \\nof the Twelfth Malaysia Plan\\nThe Twelfth Plan was anchored on the implementation of three key \\nthemes, namely resetting the economy, strengthening security, wellbeing \\nand inclusivity as well as advancing sustainability. Four catalytic policy \\nenablers, namely developing future talent, accelerating technology \\nadoption and innovation, enhancing connectivity and transport \\ninfrastructure as well as strengthening the public service supported \\nthe implementation of these themes. \\n', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\ksp_rmke_12.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

In boosting productivity growth, \\nfocus was given to, among others, strengthening the planning, \\nevaluation and monitoring mechanisms as well as scaling up green \\npractices. Meanwhile, measures to enhance the contribution of eight \\nstrategic and high impact industries as well as boost capabilities \\nof entrepreneurs and enterprises were undertaken. Strategies \\nimplemented to accelerate the development of strategic and high \\nimpact industries include boosting E&E industry in moving up the \\nvalue chain, reenergising the tourism industry and intensifying smart \\nfarming activities. Additionally, strategies to boost entrepreneurs and \\nMSMEs capacities and capabilities were implemented by creating \\ninnovative and sustainable entrepreneurs as well as a conducive and \\nholistic entrepreneurial ecosystem.\\nA total of 38 targets were set under the theme, with 15 of the targets \\nwere achieved, 20 are on track, while the remaining three are lagging. \\nMeasures to strengthen economic sectors affected by COVID-19 \\npandemic have succeeded in several areas during the review period. \\nThese include improvement in productivity growth of the manufacturing \\nsector at 5.4% per annum, and services sector at 3.6% as well as \\nhigher exports in manufacturing sector at RM1,304.7 billion in 2022, \\nmining sector at RM117.3 billion, agriculture sector at RM120.9 billion \\nand construction sector at RM6.1 billion. In addition, for strategic \\nand high impact industries, export value of E&E products reached \\nRM593 billion in 2022, average growth of domestic visitors increased \\nby 10.8% per annum, while exports of halal products registered a \\nvalue of RM59 billion in 2022. Meanwhile, digitalisation rate among \\nMSMEs reached 98.1%. Despite these achievements, the economy \\nis still lagging behind regional peers in terms of competitiveness due \\nto slow structural economic transition. Lacklustre performance of \\neconomic sectors and industry development, lack of competitiveness, \\nimpediments in the financial sector and ineffective management \\nof industrial estates and food production areas as well as MSMEs \\ninability to scale up and stay competitive continue to hamper the \\ngrowth momentum. Theme 2:  \\nStrengthening Security,  \\nWellbeing and Inclusivity\\nTheme 2 focused on strengthening security, wellbeing and inclusivity. In \\nensuring national security and sovereignty , measures were undertaken \\ntowards providing a conducive environment for economic activities \\nand safe living as well as ensuring a dignified and resilient nation. \\nThe main strategies include safeguarding national sovereignty and \\nintensifying efforts in crime prevention, rehabilitation and emergency \\npreparedness as well as improving the welfare of personnel. By the \\nend of 2022, index crime cases recorded 147 cases per 100,000 \\npopulation, better than the target. Meanwhile, the remaining two \\ntargets are on track. Despite the continuous measures undertaken to \\nensure security and sovereignty, some challenges remain and need \\nto be addressed. The challenges include the increased risk in cross \\nborder crime, lack of enforcement at border areas, increased threats \\non country’s sovereignty, escalation losses in cybercrime and lack of \\ncoordination in disaster management. \\nPriority areas implemented in improving wellbeing  consist of \\nenhancing healthcare service delivery, increasing the supply of quality \\naffordable housing, leveraging sports in building an active nation and \\nstrengthening unity for a prosperous nation. Strategies for healthcare \\ninclude implementation of measures in combating non-communicable \\ndiseases, strengthening healthcare programmes for older persons and \\ndigitalising healthcare services. Meanwhile, in increasing the supply \\nof quality affordable housing, among the efforts undertaken were to \\nimprove access to affordable housing and ensure inclusive housing. \\nStrategies to leverage sports include promoting sports for active and \\nhealthy living, and developing sports industry. Measures undertaken \\nin strengthening unity consist of programmes to promote rakyat  in \\nembracing diversity as an asset and building a more tolerance society. \\nA total of nine targets were set to enhance the wellbeing of the rakyat . \\nFrom these, two were achieved, five are on track, while the remaining \\ntwo are lagging. The hospital beds per 1,000 population was 2.07 in \\n2022, exceeding the target of 2.06 in 2025, while the National Unity \\nPolicy was formulated. Despite various measures undertaken, several \\nissues and challenges remain and need to be addressed. Among the \\nissues identified include wider disparities in healthcare, lack of quality \\nand affordable houses as well as untapped sports potential in building \\nan active society. In addition, issues related to unity include lack of \\ncross-ethnic social interactions and low comprehension of the Federal \\nConstitution and Rukun Negara .', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\ksp_rmke_12.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

In addition, priority was given to enhance \\ndevelopment of Orang Asli  community and empower specific target \\ngroups. In addressing poverty and inequality, strategies implemented \\ninclude increasing income and uplifting the standard of living of the \\npoor. Meanwhile, in empowering B40, among the strategies undertaken \\nwere to increase income and improve access to basic services. In \\nsupporting the M40 towards inclusive society, strategies implemented \\ninvolved encouraging participation in health and employment protection \\nschemes as well as increasing home ownership. In addition, strategies \\nto achieve an equitable outcome for Bumiputera  include increasing the \\nresilience and sustainability of Bumiputera  businesses and optimising \\nMalay Reserve Land and waqf instruments. Two strategies were \\nexecuted in enhancing the development of Orang Asli  community, \\nnamely strengthening education and accelerating their socioeconomic \\ndevelopment.

A total of 18 targets were set in addressing \\npoverty and building an inclusive society. Out of these targets, 15 are \\non track while three are lagging. The efforts to build an inclusive and \\nmore resilient society were not spared from challenges, notably the \\nadverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihood of low-\\nincome households as well as eroding purchasing power as a result of \\nrising cost of living. Other challenges include the prevalence of pockets \\nof poverty, vulnerability of the B40 and M40 groups, inequitable \\nBumiputera  socioeconomic outcomes, lagging development of Orang \\nAsli community and social deprivation of specific target groups.\\nIn improving regional balance and inclusivity , measures were undertaken \\ntowards optimising regional economic potential, developing sustainable \\ncities and transforming rural areas. Strategies implemented to optimise \\nregional economic potential include attracting quality investment and \\nenhancing subregional cooperation. Meanwhile, strategies to develop \\nsustainable cities include promoting effective urban planning and \\ngovernance as well as prioritising green and resilient urban development. \\nEfforts to transform rural areas were intensified by accelerating the \\nprovision of infrastructure and services as well as diversifying and \\nboosting economic activities. A total of 24 targets were set towards \\ninclusive regional development. From these, nine were achieved and the \\nrest are on track. Despite vigorous efforts to ensure regional balance \\nand inclusion, development gap between regions and states as well \\nas urban and rural areas remain. Among key issues and challenges are \\nimbalance development, low level of urban resilience, development \\nconstraints in rural areas and ineffectiveness in leveraging opportunities \\nfrom subregional cooperation.Measures undertaken in enhancing socioeconomic development in Sabah \\nand Sarawak  include solidifying provision of infrastructure, optimising \\neconomic potential, improving access to social services, enhancing \\ninclusive development and strengthening cooperation between the Federal \\nGovernment and state governments. The provision of infrastructure \\nand connectivity for both states were extended to facilitate economic \\nactivities and enable better service delivery. Strategies implemented to \\noptimise economic potential include reenergising economic activities, \\nadvancing rural development and promoting green growth. Meanwhile, \\nefforts were undertaken to improve access to education, healthcare \\nservices and affordable housing. Focus was given to enhance inclusive \\ndevelopment by addressing poverty and diversifying sources of income \\nas well as advancing socioeconomic development of Anak Negeri Sabah  \\nand Bumiputera Sarawak . In strengthening the cooperation between \\nthe Federal Government and state governments, strategies undertaken \\ninclude establishing a supportive ecosystem for cooperation and \\nenhancing collaboration among authorities. A total of 19 targets were \\nset, of which one was achieved and 18 are on track. The coverage \\nof access to clean and safe water for Sarawak was 99.1% in 2022, \\nexceeding the target of 98%.

Various strategies were undertaken \\nin advancing green growth for sustainability and resilience. In \\nimplementing a low carbon, clean and resilient development, among \\nthe strategies were strengthening actions towards a low carbon \\nnation, accelerating circular economy and encouraging sharing of \\nresponsibility in pollution prevention. Meanwhile, in managing natural \\nresources efficiently, measures undertaken include conserving the \\necosystems and enhancing conservation of water resources. Efforts \\non strengthening the enabling environment were also emphasised \\nthrough scaling-up green financing and promoting green investments \\nas well as instilling sense of ownership and shared responsibility. A \\ntotal of nine targets were set in advancing green growth. One of the \\ntargets was achieved, while the remaining five are on track and three \\nare lagging. The government green procurement for selected green \\nproducts and services recorded 27.8%, exceeding the 25% target. \\nDespite various efforts undertaken, challenges in addressing climate \\nchange and environmental degradation as well as loss of biodiversity \\nand unsustainable use of natural resources continue to persist. In \\naddition, low implementation of sustainable development goals (SDGs) \\nand low adoption of environmental, social and governance (ESG) as \\nwell as ineffective governance remain a challenge.\\nDuring the review period, measures were undertaken to  enhance \\nenergy sustainability for all. Concerted efforts were undertaken in \\nenhancing the energy sector, ensuring sustainable and progressive \\noil and gas subsector as well as enhancing the electricity subsector. \\nFive targets were set in ensuring sustainable energy. Two of the \\ntargets were achieved, while the remaining three are in progress. \\nThe National Oil & Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) Industry \\nBlueprint, 2021-2030 was launched in 2021 and the National Energy \\nPolicy, 2022-2040 in 2022. However, there are challenges that need \\nto be addressed pertaining to global climate change pressure, lack \\nof integrated plan and strategies in accelerating energy transition, \\nimpediments in the oil and gas industry as well as low deployment \\nand adoption of renewable energy (RE).\\nPriority was given on transforming the water sector  to ensure \\nwater security. In this regard, focus was given on empowering \\npeople, ensuring sustainable financing and developing sustainable \\ninfrastructure with cost-effective technology. A total of five targets \\nwere set in transforming the water sector. Out of these targets, four \\nare on track while one is lagging. Major obstacles that impeded the \\ntransformation of the water sector were lack of collaboration, lack \\nof data driven decision-making, poor governance, weak financial \\ncapability as well as ageing and outdated infrastructure.Policy Enabler 1:  \\nDeveloping Future Talent\\nIn developing future talent , priority was given to realign the labour \\nmarket and enhance talent development at all levels. Among the key \\nstrategies implemented in realigning labour market were promoting \\nhigher compensation of employees (CE) and labour participation as \\nwell as strengthening the labour market support system. Meanwhile, in \\ndeveloping future-ready talent, emphasis was given to raise the quality \\nof education and training programmes, leverage emerging technology, \\nensure equitable learning outcomes and address overlapping issues \\nin governing TVET programmes. A total of nine targets were set in \\ndeveloping future talent. From these nine targets, two were achieved, \\nsix are on track, while one is still lagging. Labour productivity per \\nworker recorded an average growth of 3.7% during the review period, \\nabove the target of 3.6%. The rate of graduate employability in HEIs \\nand public TVET institutions achieved 90.2% in 2022, exceeding the \\ntarget of 85%. However, issues and challenges in talent development \\npersist, which include inefficient labour market and less conducive \\neducation ecosystem.\\nPolicy Enabler 2:  \\nAccelerating Technology  \\nAdoption and Innovation\\nFocus was given in boosting digitalisation and advanced technology. \\nAmong the strategies implemented were providing an enabling \\nenvironment for the growth of the digital economy, expanding \\ndigitalisation, strengthening capacity and capability in research \\n& development & commercialisation & innovation (R&D&C&I) as \\nwell as gearing up for the adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution \\ntechnologies.

       " Document(page_content='8\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Executive Summary\\nMalaysia is blessed with a strategic location, vast amounts of natural \\nresources, potential renewable energy and a growing pool of talents \\nwho are appreciative of a green economy. One of the tenets of Ekonomi \\nMADANI is spurring Malaysia’s green growth for climate resilience. \\nMalaysia has been recognised as the best country in Southeast Asia in \\nthe Energy Transition Index 2023 by the World Economic Forum. The feat \\nshows that Malaysia is on the right track to drive our strategic shift and \\neconomic restructuring into new growth areas.\\nMalaysia is committed to low-carbon development aimed at restructuring the economic \\nlandscape to a more sustainable one. In this context, the National Energy Transition Roadmap \\n(NETR) sets the goal to accelerate energy transition and change the way energy is generated to \\nimprove climate resilience. NETR has developed the Responsible Transition (RT) Pathway 2050 \\nto shift Malaysia’s energy systems from fossil fuel-based to greener and low-carbon systems. The \\nTotal Primary Energy Source (TPES) modelling indicated that our energy demand will increase \\nmarginally at 0.2% annually from 95 Mtoe in 2023 to 102 Mtoe in 2050. The RT Pathway 2050 has \\nalso shown promising decarbonisation results as evidenced by the phasing out of coal and the \\nreduction of fossil-fuel reliance from 96% in 2023 to 77% in 2050.  Natural gas is set to be not \\nonly a transitional fuel, but also the primary contributor of TPES at 57 Mtoe (56%) followed by \\nrenewables that include solar, hydro and bioenergy, which collectively contribute 23% of TPES in \\n2050 from a mere 4% in 2023. \\nNETR outlines 50 initiatives under the six energy transition levers and five enablers, in addition \\nto the 10 flagship projects and initiatives announced in July 2023. The energy transition \\nfinancing will be undertaken through a combination of grants, loans, rebates, incentives, and \\nother investments to support the whole-of-nation approach. NETR aims to power our future by \\nunlocking potentials in new growth areas and delivering progress and prosperity to Malaysian \\nhouseholds and businesses. The successful implementation of NETR will uplift GDP value from \\nRM25 billion in 2023 to RM220 billion and generate 310,000 jobs in 2050. \\nNETR is not just a document about measures to meet Net-Zero GHG emissions target.

       " Document(page_content='9\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Executive Summary\\nMalaysia is a small open economy with gross domestic product (GDP) of \\nRM1.79 trillion and gross national income (GNI) per capita of USD11,780 \\nin 2022. Its population stood at 32.7 million people in 2022 and is \\nexpected to reach 40 million by 2050. Meanwhile, the urbanisation rate \\nwas 75% in 2020, and is expected to reach 85% by 2040. Economic and \\npopulation growth, as well as rapid urbanisation, will drive a rise in \\nenergy demand, which is expected to increase by 2% annually until 2050.\\nThe economy transitioned from an agricultural and commodity-based to manufacturing and services \\nin the 1980s. It continues to be a producer of finite quantities of oil and gas, which contributed \\napproximately 13% to GDP in 2021. Availability of indigenous gas resources have ensured secure energy \\nsupply at affordable prices.\\nAs the nation evolves and lifestyles change, environmental sustainability gains more focus in business and \\npolicy decisions, and this has implications on people’s livelihoods. Rapid urbanisation and climate change \\nrequire a timely adjustment of the way we live, commute and interact with our surroundings, including \\nthe way in which we consume and produce energy.Section 1 : Introduction\\n', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='10\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)The Domestic Energy Landscape\\nDefining Energy Transition  - \\nenergy transition is a structural shift \\nin energy systems, characterised by \\na transition towards cleaner sources \\nof energy, increased use of RE, and \\na significant reduction in carbon \\nemissions. The energy transition is \\nexpected to occur at an accelerated \\npace, driven by rapid technological \\nadvances and robust climate change \\npolicies.Based on the National Energy Policy, 2022-2040 (DTN), \\nthe energy sector contributed approximately 28% \\nof GDP and employed 25% of the total workforce in \\nMalaysia. In addition, it is a key source of national \\nincome, with petroleum-related products contributing \\n31% of fiscal income, and energy exports constituting \\n13% of total export value. The energy sector also \\nbenefits more than 10 million customers by providing \\ndaily access to electricity supply and enabling mobility \\nthrough reliable supply of fuels. Jobs and business \\nopportunities created in the energy sector, as well \\nas economic multipliers in energy-related supply \\nchains, also contribute positive to the socioeconomic \\ndevelopment of the nation. \\nFossil fuels continue to contribute the largest share of Malaysia’s energy supply, and have a significant \\ninfluence in shaping the country’s energy landscape. As of 2020, four energy sources dominated the \\nnational total primary energy supply (TPES) mix. Natural gas constituted the largest portion at 42.4%, \\nfollowed by crude oil and petroleum products at 27.3% and coal at 26.4%. Renewables, comprising \\nhydropower, solar and bioenergy, constituted just a mere 3.9%.\\nHistorically, the power sector in Malaysia has been operated as a vertically integrated monopoly system. \\nOver time, it has undergone various stages of liberalisation. The power sector was privatised with the aim \\nof attracting investments as well as enhancing efficiency and productivity to ensure a sufficient supply. \\nAdditionally, the government has encouraged the involvement of independent power producers (IPPs) to \\nimprove the reliability of the electricity supply and address the shortage of generation capacity in meeting \\nthe demand.\\nNatural gas plays an important role as a transitional fuel in energy transition. The government has \\nimplemented Third Party Access (TPA) in 2017 to provide healthy competition among industry players, \\nincluding the IPPs. This will facilitate the shift towards market-based pricing for power and non-power \\nsectors, thus ensuring reliable gas supply at competitive prices.\\nSimilarly, the government intends to reform the power sector further by establishing a TPA framework \\nto supply fuel sources, and access to the grid infrastructure and the retail market. In addition, the \\ngovernment will embark on electricity tariff restructuring initiative. These measures will ensure cost \\nreflective prices, enable higher penetration of RE and enhance Malaysia’s competitive advantage.\\nMalaysia has been recognised as the best country in the Southeast Asia in the Energy Transition Index \\n2023 by the World Economic Forum. The index considers system performance and the country’s readiness \\nto switch to a more environmentally friendly energy sources. The recognition shows that Malaysia is on \\nthe right track to drive our strategic shift and economic restructuring into new growth areas. This is further \\nsupported by Malaysia’s various advantages such as a strategic location, diverse RE sources and a high \\nlevel of skills to become a regional leader in energy transition.

       " Document(page_content='13\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)On 29 March 2023, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) passed a significant resolution \\nrequesting the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to outline the legal responsibilities of states concerning \\nclimate mitigation and adaptation. The current trajectory of climate change poses a threat to the global \\neconomy, trade and financial system, with potential losses amounting to nearly 10% of GDP by 2050. \\nA critical factor in addressing climate change is the energy sector, which according to the International \\nEnergy Agency (IEA), is responsible for 73.2% of GHG emissions worldwide. In limiting the global warming \\nto 1.5°C above pre-industrial level as outlined in the Paris Agreement, IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 pathway \\nsuggests that the world economy should consume 7% less energy in 2050 than at present.\\nIn 2022, the European Union (EU) introduced the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), aimed at \\npreventing carbon leakages in the trade value chain. The current scope of CBAM covers industries that are \\nimportant to Malaysia, such as iron, steel, aluminium, fertiliser, electricity and hydrogen. It is estimated \\nthat 57% of Malaysia’s total exports will be affected by the implementation of CBAM. Further, the United \\nStates (US) introduced the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, which prioritises the production of and \\ndemand for domestically produced clean energy goods and services over foreign imports.\\nThe Benefits of Energy Transition\\nThe urgency for Malaysia’s shift to sustainable energy is fuelled by global commitments, particularly \\nthe Paris Agreement and the need to fortify economic diversification and energy security. In addition, \\nindustry related to the energy transition has the potential to be a new source of growth that can benefit \\nfrom the global market. The IEA reports that investment in the development of the clean energy industry \\nis expected to reach USD1.7 trillion in 2023. The focus of global investment is on the development of the \\nRE, EE and strengthening the grid and energy storage.\\nMoreover, corporations and enterprises confront a rapidly changing market landscape where carbon costs \\nwill reshape business dynamics and potentially strain competitiveness. Meanwhile, the imminent realities \\nof climate change, exemplified by rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and escalating heatwaves \\nhighlight the direct and tangible impacts on rakyat’s daily lives.\\nBeyond mitigating risks, the energy transition presents Malaysia with the opportunity to restructure \\nits economy and maximise the potential for green growth that balances sustainability, enhances GDP, \\ncreates jobs and meet the needs of rakyat and businesses.\\nMalaysia’s Policy Responses\\nThe five-year development plan covers socioeconomic policy planning that sets out the country’s \\ndirection and growth targets as well as the allocation of the development expenditure. The Twelfth \\nPlan, outlines the aspiration for the nation to achieve net-zero GHG emissions as early as 2050. The plan \\nemphasises Malaysia’s approach to effectively manage its energy transition. It recognises the complex and \\ninterconnected nature of energy systems and acknowledges the need to balance the energy trilemma. \\nThe approach not only ensures that energy policies and programmes are environmentally responsible but \\nalso takes into consideration the socioeconomic implications.\\nThe DTN lays the groundwork for a transformation in the energy landscape. The energy transition \\nis expected to occur at an accelerated pace, driven by rapid technological advancement and robust \\nclimate change policies. The DTN’s Low Carbon Nation Aspiration 2040 (LCNA 2040) seeks to transform ', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='18\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Guiding Principles\\nThere are four guiding principles of the NETR, as shown in Exhibit 3.3. The first principle highlights the \\nimportance of aligning the energy sector based on national aspirations and commitments to sustainable \\ndevelopment.\\nThe second principle emphasises that the energy transition must be just, inclusive and cost-effective. It \\nacknowledges the challenges that exist for low-income and vulnerable populations. The NETR aims to \\nensure that the benefits and opportunities from the energy transition trickle down to every segment of \\nsociety, leaving no one behind.\\nThe third principle stresses the need for effective governance and a whole-of-nation approach. \\nCollaboration among all stakeholders is crucial to create a vibrant energy industry ecosystem that \\nsupports sustainability and facilitates the transition to a low-carbon economy.\\nThe fourth principle highlights the significance of creating high-impact job opportunities and enhancing \\nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) involvement in the ecosystem.\\n/gid00006/gid00051/gid00035/gid00036/gid00029/gid00036/gid00047/gid00001/gid01091/gid01141/gid01090/gid01143/gid00001/gid00021/gid00035/gid00032/gid00001/gid00033/gid00042/gid00048/gid00045/gid00001/gid00034/gid00048/gid00036/gid00031/gid00036/gid00041/gid00034/gid00001/gid00043/gid00045/gid00036/gid00041/gid00030/gid00036/gid00043/gid00039/gid00032/gid00046/gid00001/gid00042/gid00033/gid00001/gid00015/gid00006/gid00021/gid00019\\n/gid00006/gid00514/gid00032/gid00030/gid00047/gid00036/gid00049/gid00032/gid00001/gid00034/gid00042/gid00049/gid00032/gid00045/gid00041/gid00028/gid00041/gid00030/gid00032/gid00001\\n/gid00028/gid00041/gid00031/gid00001/gid00050/gid00035/gid00042/gid00039/gid00032/gid01162/gid00042/gid00033/gid01162/gid00041/gid00028/gid00047/gid00036/gid00042/gid00041/gid00001\\n/gid00028/gid00043/gid00043/gid00045/gid00042/gid00028/gid00030/gid00035/gid00009/gid00036/gid00034/gid00035/gid01162/gid00036/gid00040/gid00043/gid00028/gid00030/gid00047/gid00001/gid00037/gid00042/gid00029/gid00001\\n/gid00042/gid00043/gid00043/gid00042/gid00045/gid00047/gid00048/gid00041/gid00036/gid00047/gid00036/gid00032/gid00046/gid01142/gid00001/gid00020/gid00014/gid00006/gid00001\\n/gid00036/gid00041/gid00049/gid00042/gid00039/gid00049/gid00032/gid00040/gid00032/gid00041/gid00047/gid00001/gid00036/gid00041/gid00001/gid00047/gid00035/gid00032/gid00001\\n/gid00032/gid00030/gid00042/gid00046/gid00052/gid00046/gid00047/gid00032/gid00040/gid00001/gid00011/gid00048/gid00046/gid00047/gid01142/gid00001/gid00036/gid00041/gid00030/gid00039/gid00048/gid00046/gid00036/gid00049/gid00032/gid00001/gid00028/gid00041/gid00031/gid00001\\n/gid00030/gid00042/gid00046/gid00047/gid01162/gid00032/gid00514/gid00032/gid00030/gid00047/gid00036/gid00049/gid00032/gid00003/gid00028/gid00046/gid00032/gid00031/gid00001/gid00042/gid00041/gid00001/gid00041/gid00028/gid00047/gid00036/gid00042/gid00041/gid00028/gid00039/gid00001\\n/gid00028/gid00046/gid00043/gid00036/gid00045/gid00028/gid00047/gid00036/gid00042/gid00041/gid00046/gid00001/gid00028/gid00041/gid00031/gid00001\\n/gid00030/gid00042/gid00040/gid00040/gid00036/gid00047/gid00040/gid00032/gid00041/gid00047/gid00046\\nIn terms of project evaluation, the NETR subscribes to the Climate Change and Principle-Based Taxonomy \\ndefined by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM).

and project prioritisation criteria\\nReview of Renewable Energy Policies\\nIn line with the development of the NETR, the Ministry of Economy has also collaborated with NRECC to \\nreview and update existing policies on RE, leading to the following decisions:\\n• Increase the target for installed RE capacity from 40% in 2040 to 70% by 2050. The higher target is \\nexpected to generate new economic opportunities by attracting multinational companies, especially \\nRE 100 companies, to operate in Malaysia\\n• Expand RE development based on the concept of a self-contained system to encourage investment \\nin the RE value chain and diversify RE programmes according to the principle of willing buyer, willing \\nseller\\n• Scale-up the installation of solar systems in government buildings\\n• Allow cross-border RE trade through the establishment of an electricity exchange system.\\nThe establishment of RE exchange system will position Malaysia as a regional hub for RE while giving \\nadded impetus to, and building on, the ASEAN Power Grid (APG) initiative. Malaysia is currently one of the \\nkey members participating in the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-\\nPIP), the pathfinder to advance cross-border power trade among ASEAN Member States under the APG.\\nThe government is also cognisant of the need to bolster the national power grid to accommodate higher \\nRE uptake. This may come in the form of future-proofing Malaysia Electricity Supply Industry (MESI) \\nelements, including introducing smart grid features and enabling the grid for third party access.', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='20\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Complementary Plans\\nWithin the whole-of-nation approach, there has been a steady development of new policies and strategies \\nto complement NETR in strengthening Malaysia’s low-carbon transition. Among others include:\\n• the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Roadmap, Long-Term Low Emissions Development \\nStrategies (LT-LEDS) and Future Proofing MESI by the NRECC\\n• the Carbon Pricing Instrument developed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)\\n• the National ESG Industry Framework, the New Industrial Master Plan (NIMP) and the Chemical \\nIndustry Roadmap (CIR) by the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI)\\n• the Hydrogen Economy and Technology Roadmap (HETR) by the Ministry of Science, Technology and \\nInnovation (MOSTI)\\n• the National Biomass Action Plan by the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities (KPK).\\nNatural gas will continue to play a pivotal role in Malaysia’s energy landscape as the nation moves towards \\na low carbon economy. To this end, the Ministry of Economy is in the midst of developing the Natural Gas \\nRoadmap (NGR) to optimise the value of indigenous natural gas resources, increase the domestic natural \\ngas use, enhance the security of supply and access to cost-competitive natural gas, and position natural \\ngas to support Malaysia’s energy transition.', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

NETR’s Responsible Transition (RT) scenario will support \\nMalaysia’s pursuit of achieving net-zero as early as 2050.\\nRT scenario represents the best-fit ambition for the nation, considering current technology developments, \\nglobal trends and local context. The NETR’s RT aims to accelerate the pace of energy transition, with \\nimproved ambition across all six levers, as outlined in Exhibit 4.1. \\nMoving forward, the government will re-calibrate ambition levels to capitalise on new and emerging \\ntechnologies, potentially reviewing targets where possible.

System Pathway\\nNETR’s RT pathway is designed to accelerate Malaysia’s energy transition journey while balancing the \\nenergy trilemma. Towards this, the RT pathway will achieve the following by 2050:\\n• Increased use of RE in the power generation mix\\n• Close to fully phased-out coal from the power generation mix\\n• Broad based energy efficiency initiatives pursued, particularly from the demand side management that \\ninclude optimising energy consumption across key sectors, namely residential, commercial, industrial, \\nand transport to prevent wastage and indirectly prolong the lifespan of indigenous resources\\n• The shift to electrification and biofuels expedited in the transport sector.\\nThis RT will help Malaysia to shift from traditional, fossil fuel-based energy systems to a greener, low-\\ncarbon energy framework, as shown in Exhibit 4.3. With this transition, coal will be close to fully phased-\\nout, while RE will increase from 4% in 2023 to 22% in 2050. Natural gas is set to play a significant role, \\naccounting for 56% of TPES by 2050.Exhibit 4.2: Potential investment opportunities and impact of NETR’s RT', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='24\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Given the importance of energy in sustaining economic growth and socioeconomic development, the \\nNETR recognises the need to ensure progressive scaling up of RE in meeting the 70% installed capacity \\ntarget in the power mix by 2050. The potential risks of over-reliance on natural gas will be mitigated by \\nensuring RE capacity readiness as well as developing energy storage to address RE intermittency issues. \\nAs an additional measure, Malaysia will continue to explore other non-carbon energy sources that include \\nRE imports through regional interconnectors. \\nSocioeconomic Outcomes\\nThe NETR’s RT pathway has been evaluated along the energy trilemma. Overall, this pathway is set \\nto ensure eenergy security, energy equity and economic development as well as improve Malaysia’s \\nenvironmental sustainability, as shown in Exhibit

       " Document(page_content='25\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Energy Security\\nThe RT aims to achieve a notable 70% RE installed capacity mix for power sector. Despite this, Malaysia \\nwill continue to maintain diversification of its power generation mix, with the power system Herfindahl-\\nHirschman Index (HHI) remaining stable throughout projected period to 2050. \\nHowever, there are concerns about Malaysia’s growing dependence on fuel import particularly natural gas \\nimports. Given the anticipated rise in reliance on natural gas and crude oil by 2050, there is a heightened \\nneed to focus on ensuring energy security. Moving forward, Malaysia will look to reduce this dependence \\non natural gas by scaling up of RE capacity and exploring potential non-carbon energy sources. \\nIn the meantime, proactive initiatives are being undertaken to secure natural gas, such as necessary \\ninfrastructure and commercial arrangements for importation, including long-term agreements to stabilise \\nfuel imports. At the same time, it is crucial to ensure that natural gas prices for domestic consumers \\nreflects market parity. This will enhance the attractiveness of Malaysia as an investment destination for \\nupstream sector as well as incentivise third party suppliers to enter the domestic gas supply market, \\nspurring the operationalisation of TPA for gas market.\\nEnergy Equity and Economic Development\\nBy 2050, Malaysia is expected to face higher system costs due to the investments required to rapidly \\nincrease RE’s installed capacity within the country’s power generation mix. Though this trajectory might \\nsee an uptick in system costs, such an increase is inevitable given the potential scenarios of higher \\nreliance on natural gas import in the power generation mix following the projected diminishing of \\nMalaysia’s gas reserves by 2050.\\nAlthough there will be higher system costs, the RT is poised to significantly bolster Malaysia’s economic \\ndevelopment. The energy transition will catalyse growth in nascent areas such as green mobility \\necosystems, RE, energy storage, and alternative new energy ecosystems. Taking a pioneering role in these \\nemerging areas will enhance Malaysia’s competitive edge, which will yield positive outcomes for both GDP \\nand job creation.\\nThe RT is estimated to generate investment opportunities totalling between RM1.2 trillion and \\nRM1.3 trillion by 2050. These investments will contribute additional GDP of RM220 billion and create \\napproximately 310,000 green growth job opportunities in 2050. Economic benefits will be felt across the \\nsocial spectrum, with medium- and low-income households expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of \\nincome gains, as shown in Exhibit 4.5.

4.6: Projected GHG emissions reduction\\nExhibit 4.7: Benefits of NETRUtilising carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the energy sector will further bolster Malaysia’s journey \\ntowards attaining net-zero to deliver an additional 5% reduction in GHG emissions, which translates to 4.1 \\nMtCO2eq per capita. Scale-up of CCS in the energy sector will also drive the technology to become more \\neconomically feasible in other sectors such as industrial processes and product use (IPPU).\\nOther sectors, such as IPPU, agriculture, waste as well as land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) \\nwill play a critical role towards achieving net-zero target. Greater focus will be placed on adopting \\nabatement levers across IPPU, waste and agriculture, while protecting natural assets in LULUCF, which \\nfunctions as a natural carbon offsetting mechanism.\\nRT’s accelerated ambition aims to not only propel Malaysia’s energy shift towards achieving the net-zero \\nambition, but also to generate meaningful socioeconomic outcomes for the nation through GDP growth, \\njobs creation and income generation in future proof green industries, as shown in Exhibit 4.7.\\n/gid00003/gid00048/gid00046/gid00036/gid00041/gid00032/gid00046/gid00046

Of \\nthe six, EE stands out as the most important lever as it is cost effective \\nand promotes resource optimisation. RE offers diversification from \\ntraditional fossil fuels through adoption of sustainable energy sources. \\nThe focus on hydrogen recognises its potential as a clean and emerging \\nenergy carrier that can be utilised, particularly by the transportation \\nsector. Given that energy transition pathway is country specific, \\nbioenergy lever leverages Malaysia’s abundant biomass resources, \\nparticularly from agriculture, offering both economic value and a cleaner \\nenergy source. Meanwhile, from demand perspective, green mobility \\nlever addresses the significant emissions from the transportation sector \\nand aligns with urbanisation trends, advocating for cleaner urban \\ntransportation. Lastly, CCUS offers a solution for hard-to-abate industrial \\nemissions, with potential repurposing of Malaysia’s existing petroleum \\nfacilities.', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='29\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Energy Efficiency\\nOverview\\nEE offers effective long-term solutions to lower energy intensity and reduce CO2 emissions. It meaningfully \\nimproves all dimensions of the energy trilemma, by reducing demand to improve energy security, \\nlowering costs for users to enhance energy equity and minimising emissions from energy production to \\nelevate environment sustainability. \\nEE is not a new concept for Malaysia. In 2015, the Government unveiled the NEEAP, detailing a 10-\\nyear strategy to improve EE in power consumption for residential, commercial and industrial sectors. \\nCurrently, the Plan is on track to achieve its target of reducing electricity demand by 8% by 2025.\\nMalaysia must broaden its focus beyond just electricity and incorporate a wider range of energy outputs, \\nsuch as thermal energy. The forthcoming Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (EECA) bill, expected to \\nbe tabled in Parliament by the end of this year, marks a significant step in this direction. NETR will drive \\nthe attainment of RT Pathway 2050 that is both sustainable and able to propel economic growth through \\nthe efficient use of energy.\\nKey Targets\\nNETR proposes the following targets:\\n• By 2040, achieve energy savings of 21% compared to business-as-usual scenario, specifically:\\n o   Residential: 15%\\n o   Industrial and commercial: 22%\\n• By 2050, achieve energy savings of 22% compared to business-as-usual scenario, specifically:\\n o   Residential: 20%\\n o   Industrial and commercial: 23%\\nThe targets mark a significant leap from the goals previously declared in the DTN at 10% for \\nresidential and 11% for industrial and commercial by 2040.\\nChallenges\\nIn Malaysia, the adoption of energy-efficient appliances is hindered by a lack of awareness regarding their \\nbenefits and availability, which led to scarcity of demand and supply for these products. Moreover, there \\nis a disconnect between building owners and tenants, as owners are burdened with investing in energy-\\nefficient upgrades while tenants benefit from the resulting cost savings. Additionally, the scope of the \\nMinimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) encompasses only a narrow range of appliances. This \\nconstrains the potential for comprehensive energy savings across residential, commercial and industrial. \\nMeanwhile, the nascent market of energy service companies (ESCOs) faces obstacles such as limited \\nreturns on investment as well as lack of demand and viable funding opportunities.\\n', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",

5.1: Proposed structure of ESCO platform \\nand its complementary measures\\n1Malaysia Renewable Energy RoadmapESCO Platform\\nThe ESCO platform is an integrated platform for government building retrofits which connects private \\nESCOs with government projects, as shown in Exhibit 5.1. The central role of this platform would be to \\nserve as an intermediary that enables amalgamation of government building retrofitting projects and \\ncomprehensive public-private coordination in domestic ESCO market, and simplifies the engagement \\nfor private ESCOs.

       " Document(page_content='32\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Renewable Energy\\nOverview\\nFossil fuel sources still dominate the national power landscape, and contributed 33% of Malaysia’s GHG \\nemissions in 2019. Transitioning to low-emission RE is vital to decarbonise the national power system. It is \\nequally crucial that Malaysia strikes the right balance between sustainability, security, and affordability as \\nit navigates the energy trilemma towards a more resilient, low-carbon power ecosystem.\\nMalaysia is blessed with substantial RE resources, with almost 290 GW1 of technical potential estimated \\nacross the country. Solar photovoltaic (PV) technical potential alone is estimated to reach 269 GW. Just \\na small fraction of this RE potential has yet been realised, with just over 9 GW of installed capacity, and \\ngreater than 95% untapped technical potential.\\nOver the last decade, the Government of Malaysia has established long-standing programmes and \\nsupporting policies to catalyse rollout of RE technologies. These programmes have helped stimulate \\nsignificant RE growth over the past decade. Since 2011, solar PV remains the most encouraging segment \\nof the national RE landscape with an installed capacity compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 48%, \\nexpanding from 0.1 GW to 2.6 GW. \\nMalaysia has also successfully established itself as a major international hub for PV components \\nmanufacturing, building a globally recognised green energy industry.

However, the contribution \\nof RE to the total generation mix will be comparatively lower than fossil fuels, particularly natural gas. \\nThis reflects the inherent low-capacity factor associated with solar, compared against the high-capacity \\nfactor of gas. \\n• The share of coal-fired power generation is expected to ramp down over time, driven by natural \\nretirement timelines of existing coal-fired power plants. No new coal-fired power generation will be \\ndeveloped, leading to almost complete phase out by 2045. \\n• Gas is expected to act as a lower-carbon transition fuel away from baseload coal, and will be the \\ndominant source of fuel for baseload power.\\n• The ambition to achieve 70% RE share of installed capacity by 2050 is expected to be achieved, \\npredominantly driven by solar PV installation. Significant solar capacity growth is required in the next \\nthree decades, with 59 GW of installed capacity by 2050.\\nChallenges\\nThe current challenges faced by large-scale-solar (LSS) development have hindered its scalability \\nand efficiency. The scattered development approach and lengthy permitting processes lead to higher \\nfixed development costs, limiting the potential of LSS projects to significantly contribute to RE efforts. \\nRegulatory barriers and a technology-agnostic LSS bidding mechanism further impedes the growth of \\ninnovative solar technologies like floating solar and agrivoltaic. These limitations highlight the need for \\nmore streamlined and supportive frameworks to encourage broader adoption of RE solutions.\\nAdditionally, issues such as prolonged land acquisition processes and the exclusivity of the Net Offset \\nVirtual Aggregation (NOVA) programme to commercial and industrial customers limit the adoption of \\nRE. The lack of common alignment on timing, quantification and funding mechanism of grid investment \\npresents challenges in meeting RE targets. Overcoming grid limitations to accommodate higher RE \\npenetration is essential, so is the development of a TPA regulatory framework to address supply-demand \\nmismatches for corporate green power. Furthermore, the absence of RE exchange platform inhibits \\nthe potential to capitalise on price premiums associated with exporting RE and sharing of reserves. \\nTransparent price discovery mechanisms for willing buyer-willing seller are also lacking. Addressing these \\nmultiple challenges is crucial in fostering the growth of RE on a larger scale.', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='40\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Malaysia generates 13.9 million tonnes of MSW \\nannually, with this number expected to rise in \\ncoming years. Therefore, MSW represents a \\nsignificant, and expanding, source of bioenergy.

Biomass and biogas are used as zero-carbon energy supply sources for power generation. Biofuel, \\nprimarily in the form of biodiesel, is used across the transport industry. In 2019, bio-based products \\ncontributed 1% of TPES, comprising 648 kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe) of biodiesel, 204 ktoe of \\nbiomass, and 118 ktoe of biogas. \\nBioenergy is widely categorised based on the type of feedstock used to produce it:\\n• First-generation bioenergy is primarily derived from food crops such as palm oil\\n• Second-generation bioenergy is derived from non-food biomass such as agricultural waste residue, \\nforest residue, livestock waste, fisheries waste, used cooking oil (UCO), as well as municipal solid waste \\n(MSW)\\n• Third-generation bioenergy is derived from algae, and reflects a technologically nascent industry that \\nis not yet economically viable, but has the potential to emerge as a competing feedstock source of \\nbioenergy\\nDue to concerns such as land competition and food security, second generation feedstock is viewed as \\nthe current most favourable bioenergy feedstock. NETR aims to capitalise Malaysia’s strong bioenergy \\npotential, with focus on two key segments, namely agriculture-related bioenergy and non-agriculture \\nwaste such as UCO and MSW. \\n \\nPalm oil related residue consist of the majority of potential bioenergy generation potential in Malaysia, \\nas shown in Exhibit 5.6. Hence, NETR will place its focus on addressing challenges relating to palm oil \\nbiomass in agriculture-related bioenergy.

       " Document(page_content='49\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage\\nOverview\\nCCUS plays a pivotal role in energy transition. The IEA posits that reaching net-zero will be extremely \\nchallenging without CCUS and its role will extend to almost all parts of the global energy system. The \\ncontribution of CCUS will grow over time as technology improves, cost reduces and cheaper abatement \\noptions in some sectors are exhausted.\\nGlobally, there is a growing trend towards building a robust CCUS ecosystem using a cluster or hub \\nstrategy. This method encourages emitters within the same cluster to invest and utilise shared CCUS \\ninfrastructure, such as CO2 pipelines and storage facilities to reduce the overall cost of CCUS. \\nBased on the IEA’s projections, there is a noticeable disparity between the current capacity of CCUS and \\nthe anticipated future needs. The current gaps in CCUS adoption can be traced back to its nascent stage \\nand high implementation costs. Establishing comprehensive CCUS systems encompassing CO2 capture, \\ntransport, and storage, demands substantial capital investment, thus posing a significant hindrance \\nto widespread adoption. However, with the costs of CCUS technologies on a steady decline, and given \\nthe forecasted rise in carbon pricing, the economic viability of CCUS is predicted to gain considerable \\nmomentum in the coming years. \\nViability of CCUS \\nin each industry is \\ninfluenced by factors \\nsuch as regulations, \\ncarbon pricing \\nand production \\nprocesses.

       " Document(page_content='50\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)As an energy producing country, there is a pressing need for Malaysia to balance economic interests, \\nenergy security, and environmental sustainability. CCUS will help Malaysia in meeting net-zero aspiration \\nby reducing carbon emissions, especially in hard-to-abate industries. Utilising captured CO2 also catalyses \\nthe emergence of new industries, fuelling Malaysia’s green growth for climate resilience.\\nOver 20 countries worldwide have incorporated CCUS into their plans to reach net-zero emissions, \\nhighlighting its prominent role in energy transition. While Malaysia has yet to develop policy and \\nregulatory framework on CCUS, Budget 2023 has introduced several tax incentives for companies \\nundertaking in-house CCS activity, companies undertaking CCS activity and companies using CCS \\nservices. This approach highlights CCS’ role as a new source of economic growth and in achieving net-zero \\nGHG emissions.\\nChallenges\\nMalaysia faces challenges in developing CCUS due to the technology’s nascent status. The country lacks \\nregulatory framework and governance necessary to galvanise CCUS development. Given the high costs \\nassociated with CCUS technology, incentives and access to funding with competitive rates are needed to \\nmotivate emitters to adopt CCUS. Internationally, government support has been the primary catalyst for \\nthe adoption of CCUS amongst emitters and for the development of CCUS hubs. \\nMalaysia has yet to accede to regulations such as the London Protocol and the EU CCS Directive to enable \\nthe transboundary transport and storage of CO2. Although transboundary transport and storage of CO2 \\nis a potential source of growth, Malaysia has not developed its domestic policy on CCUS to allow for the \\nintegration of international regulations into domestic regulatory framework. For the seamless import \\nand storage of CO2 within Malaysian borders, aligning with these established international regulations is \\nparamount.\\nWhilst the main objective of capturing CO2 through CCUS is geared towards storage, there are instances \\nwhere the utilisation of CO2 proves both economically and commercially viable. Such opportunities are \\nstill lacking and deserve exploration. Strategic government incentives and specific mandates can act \\nas catalysts, encouraging the use of CO2 in sectors such as precast concrete, urea production, and other \\napplicable areas.Key targets\\nNETR proposes the following targets:\\n• By 2030:\\n o Develop 3 CCUS hubs (2 in Peninsular Malaysia, 1 in Sarawak)\\n o Total storage capacity up to 15 Mtpa \\n• By 2050:\\n o Develop 3 carbon capture hubs \\n o Total storage capacity between 40 to 80 Mtpa', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n",

7.2: Malaysia’s energy transition financing needs Financing and Investments\\nOverview \\nFinancing Malaysia’s energy transition constitutes a significant undertaking that requires the adept \\nutilisation of a wide spectrum of funding channels. The overarching objective is to achieve energy \\ntransition targets while ensuring fiscal sustainability. This enabler identifies the existing financing gaps \\nand recommends a series of initiatives aimed at expediting the influx of capital investments and leverage \\ndiverse capital pools to achieve NETR targets. \\nEstimation of investment needs\\nNETR anticipates that Malaysia will require an investment of RM1.2 trillion to RM1.3 trillion by 2050, based \\non the financial requisites, as shown in Exhibit 7.2. In this decade, 18% of funding is required primarily \\nin RE power generation and green mobility. Investment in RE power generation entails the expansion of \\nsolar PV and hydropower, and strengthening of grid infrastructure. For green mobility, the investments \\nare for the expansion of public transportation, amplification of domestic EV production capacities, and \\nincreased manufacturing of EV charging infrastructure.\\nHydrogen and CCUS technologies will also require significant investments considering their nascent \\nstatus, necessitating substantial scale-up efforts. The commitment in improving energy efficiency, \\nadvancing sustainable aviation and marine transport capabilities, and establishing green skilling \\nprogrammes also demands substantial investments. \\nThe utilisation of diverse capital pools will be leveraged to facilitate energy transition, as shown in Exhibit \\n7.3. Energy transition projects are categorised according to their potential financial yields and the nature \\nof funding that could be mobilised.', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='58\\nNational Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR)Focusing on Malaysia’s immediate energy transition needs, a significant proportion of projects will be \\nclassified as marginally bankable or yielding below-market returns. This is primarily due to significant \\ninvestments in the EV value chain, hydrogen  infrastructure, CCUS technologies, as well as the rapid \\nadvancement of the energy efficiency sector in Malaysia, which mostly are at a nascent stage.\\nInvestments in RE power generation, such as solar PV and hydropower, along with grid enhancements, \\nare categorised as commercially viable or with market-rate returns. These projects typically possess the \\ncapacity to secure funding from capital markets and domestic financial institutions but require robust \\npolicy support to accelerate adoption. \\nProjects that yield no financial returns pertain to investments fulfilling public service obligations or \\nthose that are aligned with a social-focused mandate. This encompasses initiatives such as upskilling \\nand reskilling programmes aimed at aiding the workforce impacted by the energy transition as well as \\nenhancing nationwide public transportation infrastructure. \\n \\nChallenges\\nGiven that energy transition is a capital-intensive endeavour, energy transition projects are still \\nsurrounded by apprehensions on the commercial viability of initiatives that might be characterised as \\ntechnologically immature or those that have not yet reached commercial scale. In the context of Malaysia, \\nthe unproven markets refer to CCUS, green hydrogen, BESS and SAF. \\nCertain projects are deemed small-scale initiatives and fail to attract the attention of major investors \\nand financial institutions. This translates into higher development costs that directly affect the project \\ndevelopers. Notable examples of projects are energy efficiency and bioenergy, which frequently face \\nscalability challenges.Exhibit 7.3: Short-term national energy transition financing needs

the human capital aspects of the energy transition presents multifaceted challenges. The \\ndiminishing job opportunities in GHG-intensive sectors like oil and gas, ICE vehicle manufacturing and \\nfossil fuel-based power generation necessitate strategies to transition workers to new employment \\nopportunities. Bridging the gap between existing workforce skill sets and the emerging demand for green \\nskills, such as in hydrogen and CCUS, requires targeted training and upskilling initiatives. Moreover, \\naddressing low energy literacy levels is vital to ensure informed decision-making and active participation \\nin the transition to a more sustainable energy landscape. An equitable and just energy transition must \\naddress these challenges to create a workforce prepared for the future while upholding social inclusivity.', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 60}),\n",

It is crucial to facilitate conditions to foster innovation and new technology \\napplications to create technological advantages across the energy sector. In addition, the scaling up of \\nmajor energy infrastructure investments will be required to safeguard energy security, improve energy \\naccess and enhance environmental sustainability. Support will also be needed to encourage innovation \\nespecially for technologies at early stages of the maturity curve, but with high potential benefits and \\nscalability. \\nChallenges\\nThe energy transition encounters significant technological and infrastructure challenges. The slow \\ngradual uptake of sustainable practices within domestic industries impedes the swift transition to cleaner \\nenergy sources. The absence of a robust energy knowledge platform tailored for SMEs and businesses \\nhinders the dissemination of effective energy transition strategies. Addressing these hurdles is essential to \\naccelerate the integration of sustainable technologies and the establishment of supportive infrastructure, \\nfostering a more efficient and effective transition towards a greener energy landscape.\\nKey Initiatives\\nEnabler: Technology and Infrastructure\\nCode Initiatives Champions\\nEN10 Accelerate development of domestic industries for green \\nmanufacturing and adoption of green technologies\\no Develop programmes tailored to support SME involvement in the \\ngreen value chain in the form of technical expertise and financial \\nsupportMITI\\nEN11 Develop a National Energy Knowledge Hub for public access\\no Establish a one-stop centre for energy transition data, information \\nand programmes under the purview of MTNMinistry of \\nEconomy', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NETR_Roadmap_0.pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",

Three previous iterations of the \\nIndustrial Master Plans have driven industrial \\ndevelopment in Malaysia, with the Government \\nadopting industrial development strategies \\nrelevant to the period to transform the \\neconomy. Malaysia flourished from a low-\\nproductivity agrarian-based economy and is \\nheading towards achieving developed nation \\nstatus, underpinned by robust manufacturing \\nand services sectors. The strategy has \\nsuccessfully raised the living standards of the \\nRakyat  and propelled remarkable growth \\nin Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, \\nincreasing 34 times between 1967 to 2019, \\nmaking Malaysia one of the fastest growing \\neconomies in modern history. \\nIndustrial policies have since become more \\ndiverse and complex, incorporating new \\nimperatives including the integration into the global value chain (GVC), development \\nof indigenous capabilities in a knowledge \\neconomy, evolution of environmental, social \\nand governance (ESG) criteria and disruptions \\nfrom the new industrial revolution. The question \\nis not about the necessity of such policies, but \\nrather what new policies are required and how \\nto proceed.\\nGiven the current challenging environment, \\nbenchmarking and learning from other \\ncountry’s experiences are no longer sufficient. \\nMalaysia needs to embark on its own path \\ninto unchartered territory, to steer the nation \\ninto the challenging future. The combined \\nimpact of the new imperatives and the recent \\npandemic has compelled the Government to \\nrethink Malaysia’s industrial strategy.\\nWith the NIMP 2030, Malaysia intends \\nto transform the industry into greater \\nheights, capitalising on emerging global \\ntrends, supply chain disruptions, current \\ngeopolitical landscape, digitalisation and ESG \\nconsiderations. These trends are moving at an \\nunprecedented pace and Malaysia has to act \\nfast.\\nTherefore, the NIMP 2030 is designed to \\nachieve the aspirations in a span of seven \\nyears and takes on a Mission-based approach \\nfor industrial development. This approach \\nunites Malaysia by encouraging collaboration \\nbetween the Government and the private \\nsector to rally the industries.\\nPURPOSE OF THE NIMP 2030\\nThe NIMP 2030 sets forth Malaysia’s future \\ndirection in industrial transformation. It \\nprovides a national integrated plan for resilient \\nindustrial development until 2030 – setting the \\nfundamentals for future policy development \\nand enabling the industry at all levels. It \\narticulates Malaysia’s position and participation \\nin the global economic environment. The NIMP 2030 serves to:\\n• Provide national strategic direction to lead \\nthe industrial development policies;\\n• Be a conversation piece for investors and \\nother economies on Malaysia’s position and \\ndirection; and\\n• Feature the role of the Malaysian \\nGovernment in shaping the economy.', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NIMP_2030.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

The sector has been playing a pivotal role in driving economic growth by \\ncontributing approximately 24 per cent to the country’s GDP and accounting for 84 per cent of \\nMalaysia’s total exports. Both GDP and exports of the sector have been growing at 6 per cent since \\n2000 and 2006 respectively. In parallel, the sector supports the livelihoods of 2.7 million individuals, \\nrepresenting approximately 17 per cent of total employment in Malaysia. Manufacturing therefore \\nserves as a cornerstone for the nation’s international competitiveness, economic resilience and \\nhuman capital development. \\nIn terms of the services sector, the rapid growth in services contributed to Malaysia’s \\nindustrialisation development as it has a positive relationship to manufacturing performance1. \\nAccess to services such as telecommunications, logistics and financing will impact the \\ncompetitiveness of manufacturing firms.\\nPAST PERFORMANCE AND KEY CHALLENGES\\nThe performance of the manufacturing and services sectors against IMP3’s macro targets are \\ntabulated below (Table 2.1)2 . \\nTable 2.1: Key Macro Targets for IMP3\\nTargets Baseline (2005) Target (2020) Realised 2020 Realised 2022\\nGDP Value of \\nmanufacturing \\nsector3  RM149.7 billion\\n(based on constant \\n2005 prices)RM187.6 billion\\n(based on 1987 real \\nprices)RM307.8 billion\\n(based on constant \\n2015 prices)RM364.5 billion\\n(based on constant \\n2015 prices)\\nShare of \\nmanufacturing \\nsector (% of GDP)31.4% 28.5% 22.3% 24.2% \\nShare of non-\\nGovernment \\nservices (% of GDP)50.5% 59.7 % 48.5% 49.1%\\nShare of \\nGovernment \\nservices (% of GDP)7.6% 6.8% 9.2% 9.1%\\nImplemented \\nprivate \\nInvestments \\n(cumulative)4 Total: \\nRM464.5 billionManufacturing: \\nRM412.2 billion\\nServices: \\nRM687.7 billionManufacturing: \\nRM652.4 billion \\nServices5: \\nRM139.9 billionManufacturing: \\nRM862.8 billion \\nServices6: \\nRM211.2 billion\\nExternal Trade Exports: RM533.8 \\nbillion\\nTotal trade: \\nRM967.8 billionExports: \\nRM1.4 trillion \\nTotal trade:\\nRM2.8 trillionExports: \\nRM980.99 billion\\nTotal trade: \\nRM1.77 trillionExports:\\nRM1.55 trillion\\nTotal trade:\\nRM2.48 trillion\\nSource: DOSM (Sectoral GDP); MIDA (Investments); MATRADE (Trade)', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NIMP_2030.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

In terms of value, manufacturing’s GDP broadly doubled and \\nexceeded its IMP3 targets. In 2020, Government services exceeded its target by 2.4 percentage \\npoints. However, non-Government services fell short of its IMP3 target by 11.2 percentage points.\\nIn terms of the implemented private investments, the manufacturing sector performed above \\nexpectations and doubled the target set in IMP3 as of 2022. However, services fell short – its \\ninvestment in 2022 stood at 30.7 per cent of the IMP3’s target7. This may be explained partly by \\nMalaysia’s higher Services Trade Restrictiveness Index in most services compared to its peers8.\\n  \\nMalaysia’s trade performance in 2022 was RM2.48 trillion. Although it was RM32 billion less than \\nthe IMP3 target, it grew by 2.5 times relative to its baseline value. Zooming in to exports specifically, \\nMalaysia exceeded its target by RM569 billion. The growth is driven by the outstanding trade \\nperformance of E&E products, petroleum products, liquified natural gas, palm oil and palm oil-\\nbased agriculture products, machinery, equipment and parts – each recorded its highest export \\nvalue ever, increasing by more than RM10 billion and registering double-digit growth.\\nAlthough the manufacturing and services sectors have made some progress over the years, it is \\ncrucial to acknowledge that there are key challenges in industrialisation development in Malaysia:\\nMarginal improvement in economic complexity:\\nMalaysia’s degree of economic complexity as measured by the Economic Complexity Index \\n(ECI)9 peaked in 2013, dipped in 2014 and stagnated till 2020.

For example, \\naccess to telecommunications, transport, distribution services and financial intermediation can \\naffect the competitiveness of manufacturing firms. Malaysia’s direct contribution of services to \\nmanufacturing value-added is much lower than the OECD average and neighbouring countries. \\nImproving the use of MRS in Malaysia can help to facilitate better manufacturing performance by \\nboosting the competitiveness of manufactured goods.\\nStagnated labour productivity:\\nLabour productivity growth in Malaysia has significantly slowed down in the past three decades, \\nparticularly from 2011 to 2018. Malaysia’s labour productivity growth has been lower than Singapore, \\nThailand and the Philippines since 2000, and even lower than Viet Nam since 2005 (Figure 2.2). \\nThis decline in labour productivity is explained by: \\n• Prolonged use of low-skilled foreign workers in the manufacturing sector:\\nMalaysia had early mover advantage as it opened up to FDI liberalisation with the establishment \\nof the Bayan Lepas Free Trade Zone in 1971 and attracted FDI to establish export-oriented, \\nlabour-intensive manufacturing with the help of its relatively low labour costs at that time. \\nSubsequently, other developing countries, like China, has opened up to FDI and attracted low \\nlabour-cost manufacturing, posing stiff competition for Malaysia. Malaysia prolonged its use \\nof low-skilled foreign workers to stay on in labour-intensive manufacturing instead of moving \\non to more technology-intensive activities, which then delayed the upgrading of the Malaysian \\nmanufacturing sector.\\n• Relatively low innovation performance:\\nThe country’s investment in R&D12 as a percentage of GDP has fallen since 2016 (Figure 2.3) and its \\nGlobal Innovation Index13 fell from a peak of 46.9 in 2013 to a low of 38.7 in 2022.

In 2019, the DVX share accounted for 29 per cent, up from 18 per cent in 1995. The \\nshare of FVA remained higher than the DVX, at 36 per cent in 2019.\\nAnother challenge in investments is that DDI has been on a general downward trend since 2017, \\nindicating the need for strategic measures to facilitate domestic investments.\\n \\nDisparities in manufacturing activities across States hamper inclusive growth: \\nManufacturing development is unevenly distributed throughout the different States in Malaysia. \\nThe three main States contributing to manufacturing value-added in the west coast of Peninsular \\nMalaysia are Selangor, Johor and Penang, along with Sarawak in East Malaysia.

Instead, it is essential \\nto prepare for the desired future economy. \\nThis requires a keen awareness of significant \\nglobal trends that will influence Malaysia’s \\ndevelopment in the coming decade. Three \\nmega trends will affect the future of trade and \\ninvestment globally, including Malaysia.\\nGeopolitical shifts – focus on economic \\nsecurity \\nThe world of today is marked by ‘polycrisis’. \\nIndustrial development faces multiple threats \\nacross various dimensions. These range from \\nthe uneven recovery following the COVID-19 \\npandemic to climate change catastrophes, as \\nwell as rising geopolitical tensions between \\ncountries. \\nBuilding resilience has become an important \\npolicy and strategic tool for managing this \\nincreasingly complex web of global risks. In \\nthe face of growing supply chain disruptions, \\ncountries have had to shift their focus from \\neconomic efficiency to economic security. \\nIndustry players these days prefer a shorter \\nand more secure supply chain to provide \\ngoods and services more seamlessly. In this \\nregard, there are several key trends in supply \\nchain management and geopolitics that \\ncountries need to incorporate in their industrial \\npolicy planning. These include nearshoring \\n(preferring to invest closer to the investors’ \\ncountry or origin) and friendshoring (preferring \\nto set up manufacturing facilities in countries \\nthat are geopolitical allies).\\nMalaysia stands to gain from these \\ndevelopments. This recent trend is illustrated \\nby the move of notable global players to turn \\nto Southeast Asia as the “Plus One” to ensure \\neconomic security and supply chain resilience. \\nApart from that, ASEAN is becoming the \\nalternative choice due to its strategic location, \\ntrack record on industrial development and \\ninvestment management as well as its relative \\nmacroeconomic and political stability. \\nMalaysia and the ASEAN economies are \\nintertwined in trade and investment with both \\nwarring economies. This unlocks opportunities \\nto integrate in the GVC as there is considerable appetite for nearshoring and friendshoring in \\nthe region among global investors, especially \\nto export to the US and European Union (EU). \\nThe ASEAN economies stand to benefit from \\nthese developments. Moving forward, Malaysia \\nand its ASEAN neighbours should push for \\ngreater vertical integration across value chains, \\nparticularly in semiconductors, clean energy, \\ncritical minerals and other sectors of strategic \\nimportance. This implies a focus on working \\ntogether to build regional strength and \\ncomplement one another rather than being a \\nzero-sum game. \\nThe Government understands the importance \\nof advancing in tandem with the ASEAN \\neconomies. By integrating with the ASEAN \\neconomies, Malaysia stands to be an \\nindispensable part of the GVC. The way forward \\nshould involve further push for an international, \\nrules-based order, while maintaining ASEAN \\ncentrality29.\\n \\nDigitalisation \\nAs the world and Malaysia move towards \\nembracing a digital economy, the internet \\nhas become an indispensable utility for \\naccelerating digitalisation. The pandemic has \\nadded fuel to the surge in digitalisation as \\ncompanies were forced to adapt to working \\nfrom home and opting for online operations \\nduring the lockdown periods. \\nEmbracing digitalisation bolsters companies’ \\nresilience to shocks by safeguarding labour \\nproductivity and employment during \\nchallenging times. This can contribute towards \\nlonger term labour productivity, based on \\nhistorical evidence from the US and more \\nadvanced European economies30.\\nApart from raising productivity, digital \\ntransformation can help companies create \\nvalue and spur innovation. Specifically, digital \\ntransformation enables manufacturing \\ncompanies to improve their operations and \\ninventory management, as well as employee \\nand customer management. Smart technology \\ncan ensure a safe working environment, \\nimprove productivity rate and product quality. \\nMalaysia’s digital economy grew faster, at 8 \\nper cent per annum than the GDP growth at 5 \\nper cent per annum, between 2015 and 201831.

For instance, the use of less \\ncarbon-intensive fuels, which may drive up \\nthe costs of production in the short-term. Physical risks from climate change can be \\ndisruptive to businesses, from physical asset \\ndamages due to flood and supply-side shocks \\nwhich would result in higher commodity \\nprices and migration of people33.

Of \\nsignificance, the industrial upgrading of capabilities especially through horizontal and vertical \\nintegration are becoming important features within a modern and competitive production \\nstructure, especially with more flexible processes driven by automation and digitalisation.\\nAll manufacturing and MRS sectors have the opportunities to expand to high value-added \\nactivities, for instance:\\n• E&E  – Adopt higher level of technology in advanced packaging, such as Fan-Out Wafer-Level \\nPackaging and Chiplet die-to-die packaging;\\n• M&E  – Expand into refurbishing services (e.g. industrial turbines and generators) and energy \\nefficient solutions (e.g. water and wind turbines, and photovoltaic power generating systems); \\n• Metal  – Develop flat products, such as hot-rolled sheets and strips, plates, galvanised sheets \\nand other metallic coated sheets;\\n• Food processing  – Expand into ready-to-eat meals and alternative proteins; and\\n• Textile  – Leverage smart and advanced textiles for defence, automotive interior furnishings, \\nmedical, geo-textile and sportswear.\\nIn this strategy, Malaysia emphasises on expansion to higher value-added activities from design \\nand development, product development, supply chain management to integrated services \\nsolution delivery. Among the high-tech manufacturing industries identified for this strategy \\ninclude E&E, chemical, advanced materials, aerospace, pharmaceutical and medical devices, \\nwhich can generate high economic and innovation knowledge spillovers. Going forward, Malaysia \\nstrives to shift away from traditional manufacturing models (e.g. contract manufacturing) and \\nmethods towards becoming an innovation-led manufacturing hub. \\nTo achieve this, five Action Plans have been formulated: \\nThe E&E sector forms about 40 per cent of Malaysia’s manufacturing exports (twelfth largest \\nexporter of E&E products and sixth largest exporter of semiconductor in the world36). With \\nsemiconductors making about 60 per cent of the total E&E exports, Malaysia is currently among \\nthe leading hub for assembly, including outsourced, testing and packaging activities. Building \\non these capabilities and trends such as the digital revolution which require more advanced \\nchips with greater computational power and memory capacity, Malaysia aims to develop a more \\nintegrated involvement across the front-end and back-end semiconductor ecosystem. This will \\nbe crucial even as the future semiconductor manufacturing moves towards advanced packaging \\nmodels, where multiple chip dies are integrated within a single package to minimise fabrication \\ncost and yield higher performance. \\nOn the front-end of activities, Malaysia aims to deepen involvement in the Integrated Circuit \\n(IC) design which confers higher profit margins and greater specialisation within the global \\nsemiconductor value chain. IC design - which includes design of both physical integrated circuits \\nand associated software - accounts for roughly half of global semiconductor industry R&D \\ninvestment and value-added. Furthermore, the design of ICs has a sustainable and competitive \\nadvantage if close collaboration can be promoted with OEMs in high-technology industries such \\nas mobile communication, defence, medical devices and automotive that requires ICs embedded \\nwithin their systems.STRATEGY 1.1\\nACTION PLAN \\n1.1.1Expand to high value-added activities of the value \\nchain\\nCreate global IC design champions from Malaysia', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NIMP_2030.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",

This is contributed by the \\nindustry’s adoption and adaptation of frontier \\ntechnologies and access to finance the \\ntechnologies. \\nThe Industry4WRD policy was introduced in \\n2018 to accelerate Malaysia’s manufacturing \\nsector’s digitalisation journey. The aim was to \\ntransform the manufacturing sector and MRS \\nto adopt Industry 4.0 technologies in order \\nto increase the level of labour productivity, \\nelevate contribution of manufacturing to the \\neconomy, strengthen innovation capacity and \\ncapability and increase the number of high-\\nskilled workers in the manufacturing sector. \\nDespite the efforts undertaken, the \\nperformance of the manufacturing sector \\nhas not shown significant improvement. The \\ngrowth rate of Malaysia’s labour productivity \\nhas slowed down in the last three decades \\nand this decline was further exacerbated by \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. This is attributed to \\nprolonged use of low-skilled labours, relatively \\nlow innovation and low technology adoption in \\nthe manufacturing industry. \\nIt is imperative for companies to adopt \\ndigitalisation and shift away from low-skilled \\nlabour. This is to increase labour productivity \\nand create more high-skilled jobs for the \\nindustry. With the changing global landscape, \\nit is no longer sufficient to merely go digital; \\nthe future growth of Malaysia hinges on the \\norganisations’ ability to embrace a digital \\nmindset and fully embody digital capabilities \\nacross all aspects of the manufacturing \\nprocesses.\\nSimilarly, the Government will accelerate \\ndigitalisation and integration to support the \\nindustry. By streamlining and digitalising \\nprocesses, it will improve the delivery of public \\nservices and ease the process of doing business \\nin Malaysia. Collectively, both the Government and industry \\nwill spur technology innovation and create \\nmore local technology solutions.  By supporting \\nhomegrown talent and encouraging disruptive \\nideas, Malaysia can transition from being a \\ntechnology provider to a technology creator.\\nThe urgency of the digital transformation \\ncannot be understated. It is essential to act \\nswiftly and proactively seize the opportunities \\nthat digitalisation offers to remain competitive \\nin the rapidly evolving global landscape.\\nThe successful implementation of Strategies \\nand Action Plans under Mission 2 will result in \\nimpactful outcomes as follow:\\n• Enable economic complexity: \\nThe use of technology enhances labour \\nproductivity and efficiency, enabling businesses \\nto allocate resources to more complex activities. \\nAdvanced technology enables R&D activities, \\nwhich will drive innovation to develop high \\nvalue-added products;\\n• Emergence of high-skilled jobs: \\nTechnology and digital adoption creates the \\ndemand for more high-skilled jobs such as \\ndata scientists, data engineers, data analysts, \\nartificial intelligence engineers and specialists, \\nsystem integrators, cybersecurity engineers \\nand other tech-related services professionals; \\nand\\n• Creation of new clusters: \\nTechnology acts as a catalyst for disruptive \\nideas, enables knowledge exchange and \\ncollaboration, and attracts talented individuals. \\nThis fosters innovation and spurs economic \\nactivity, contributing to the formation of new \\nclusters.

It leverages \\non technology and automation to create and \\ndeliver products and services more efficiently. \\nApart from that, a smart factory collaborates \\nwith other areas within a company’s value \\nchains to optimise operations and enhance \\noverall labour productivity.\\nRationale\\nThe rationale for this MBP is based on the \\nfollowing factors:\\n• Transforming into smart factories will lead \\nto an increase in labour productivity; \\n• It will shift the manufacturing industry from \\nlow-skilled labour to high-skilled workers. \\nThis will increase wages and improve the \\nlivelihood of the nation, thus expanding the \\nmiddle-class society;\\n• It can build supply chain resilience as the \\nuse of automated machineries can reduce \\nproduction downtime. Apart from that, the \\nuse of predictive analytics is able to identify \\nand mitigate supply chain shortages; and\\n• It can catalyse other industries in Malaysia \\nto support the transformation of smart \\nfactories. For instance:\\n• Machineries and equipment sector to \\nproduce system integration, robotics, \\n3D printing and imaging technology \\nand other Industry 4.0 technologies;\\n• E&E sector to produce advanced chips \\nand IoT sensors for fully automated \\nmachinery; and\\n• ICT sector to supply software \\ndevelopment, AI, 5G, cloud computing \\nand cybersecurity that enables \\nautomation with less human \\ninteraction.\\nThe shift towards smart factories is crucial for \\nMalaysia to remain at the forefront of global \\nmanufacturing trends. In the past, Malaysia \\nhad a competitive advantage due to relatively \\nlow labour cost. Now, as other countries recognised the benefits of technology and \\nautomation, Malaysia is faced with high \\ncompetition. Together with FMM, MDEC and \\nSIRIM, concerted efforts with other Ministries, \\nAgencies and industry players are required to \\nsupport this transformation.\\nActions\\nThe following activities will be conducted for \\nthis MBP:\\n• Leverage the enhanced Industry4WRD RA \\nand IF to prepare the industry to transform \\ninto smart factories.

Different sectors require different mechanisms to \\nadapt to the climate change-induced risks. There are sector-specific challenges and vulnerabilities \\nfor which solutions must be catered to. The sectoral adaptation pathways will include measures \\nto address:\\n• Changes to infrastructure to adapt to physical risks;\\n• Diversification of sources for critical resources such as energy and feedstock to minimise \\nsupply chain risk; and\\n• Adoption of technology.\\nMITI will collaborate with NRECC to execute this action plan and the following activities will be \\nconducted:\\n• Develop sectoral adaptation pathway with the consideration of the current and future climate \\nrisks, potential vulnerabilities and climate change impact;\\n• Promote awareness of the pathways and provide incentive to encourage adaption; and\\n• Introduce policy measure to accelerate the implementation.\\nMalaysia’s GDP loss by 2048 could be as high as 46 per cent due to physical climate impacts52. \\nWhile this is alarming, the adaptation process can serve as an opportunity to grow local climate \\nadaptation-related industries and service providers.\\nThe existence of an adaptation industry can help the Government and other industries manage \\nthe impact of sea level rise, coastal erosion, floods, heat stress, agricultural adaptation and other \\nforms of infrastructural effects. For example, according to a report by the National Hydraulic \\nResearch Institute of Malaysia (2018), Port Klang is expected to be submerged towards the end \\nof the century with over 1m of sea level rise, based on sea level rise studies that it referred to. The \\nGovernment shall collaborate with key stakeholders such as port operators, logistics providers, \\nengineers and scientists to implement major infrastructural measures for climate risk mitigation. \\nTo execute this action plan, MITI will collaborate with KKR, KE, NRECC and MOSTI. The following \\nactivities will be conducted:\\n• Identify risks of physical climate hazards that could cause disruption to industrial structures, \\nsupply chain continuity and daily operations.\\n• Determine product and service providers for the provision of climate adaptation advice and \\nsubsequent implementation of climate adaptation measures.\\n• Identify opportunities to grow climate adaptation product and service providers for the export \\nmarket.ACTION PLAN \\n4.2.2Foster an adaptation industry to provide adaptation \\nproducts and services (including exports)', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NIMP_2030.pdf', 'page': 125}),\n",

SMEs in Malaysia are \\ndiverse, ranging from traditional businesses \\nto growing sectors such as manufacturing, \\nservices and technological industries.\\nSMEs form the backbone of the Malaysian \\neconomy, creating roughly 97 per cent of \\ntotal business establishments in the country. \\nThey account for a substantial portion of \\nemployment (circa 48 per cent) in Malaysia55.\\nIn the NIMP 2030, SMEs have a significant \\nrole, acting as key suppliers of local content, \\nproviding value chain and export support and \\ncontributing to overall regional development.  \\nThese position them as crucial economic contributor towards achieving the NIMP 2030 \\nGoals and Missions.\\nThe economic contribution by the SMEs is, \\nhowever, not without challenges. There are \\nseveral key areas that must be addressed, such \\nas technical skills shortage, low technology \\nadoption, access to financing and regulatory \\ncompliance.\\nSMEs contribute to about 38 per cent of the \\ntotal GDP in Malaysia and 8.5 per cent of SMEs \\nparticipate in the manufacturing industry. \\nLabour productivity rate of SMEs is 20 per cent \\nlower than the national average and this is \\nlargely due to the size of SMEs (78 per cent of \\ntotal Malaysian MSMEs are classified as micro \\nenterprises)56.\\nMalaysian SMEs will play an integral role in \\nfulfilling the Missions and Goals set in the NIMP \\n2030.\\nAdvance economic complexity\\nSMEs form a crucial part in the value chain \\nof larger industries. They support the larger \\ncorporations by acting as suppliers and \\nsubcontractors, providing components, raw \\nmaterials and specialised services.\\nSMEs are a source to innovation in the economy. \\nAs the country moves towards climbing the \\nvalue chain by providing higher value-added \\nactivities, SMEs are deemed to be more agile \\nand flexible to introduce new products and \\nspecialised services. This will springboard \\nMalaysia towards economic growth and \\ndiversification. \\nThe NIMP 2030 will provide access for SMEs to \\nsupport activities in new higher value-added \\nopportunities in manufacturing and MRS. \\nEfforts will be put in place to encourage SMEs \\nto collaborate with LLCs and MNCs to deliver \\nsolutions at scale, addressing any resource \\nlimitations faced and bridging any technical \\ngaps that may arise.Tech up for a digitally vibrant nation \\nSMEs in Malaysia are poised to adopt \\ndigitalisation to improve labour productivity. \\nThere will be opportunities to develop \\ninnovative digital solutions that are scalable \\nand agile to support the NIMP 2030’s mission \\nto transform Malaysia into a digitally-driven \\nnation.\\nThe NIMP 2030 will enhance technology \\nadoption programmes for manufacturing SMEs \\nto increase labour productivity and reduce \\nreliance on foreign low-skilled labour. There \\nwill be programmes to develop technology \\nsolution providers for start-ups and SMEs \\nto complement the need for local solution \\nproviders under the Technology Adoption \\nProgramme. \\nPush for Net Zero\\nFollowing the nation’s pledge to achieve \\nNet Zero carbon emissions as early as 2050, \\nMalaysian SMEs are given the opportunity to \\ncontribute towards the country’s sustainability \\ngoals and in adopting ESG principles.

Continuous training and development programmes are vital to enhance the \\ncapabilities of employees and ensure they stay relevant to the industry’s advancements.\\nTechnological adoption and digitalisation\\nEmbracing technology and digital tools can significantly enhance SMEs’ competitiveness. This \\nincludes implementing productivity-enhancing software, exploring automation opportunities \\nand embracing Industry 4.0 technologies, to improve operational efficiency, support innovation \\nand enable SMEs to stay ahead in a digital-driven economy.\\nNetworking and collaboration\\nBy building strategic partnerships with suppliers, distributors and industry associations, SMEs \\ncan access new markets, share resources and leverage each other’s strengths. Collaborative \\ninitiatives and knowledge sharing can foster innovation, enhance market presence and open \\ndoors to business opportunities.\\nAccess to financing\\nAdequate financial support is essential to invest in equipment, technology upgrades and working \\ncapital. Access to various funding options, from capital market investments, financial institutions \\nand government support programmes tailored to SMEs will enable SMEs to seize growth \\nopportunities, expand their operations and stay competitive in the manufacturing and services \\nsector.\\nBy focusing on these key success factors, the Malaysian manufacturing and MRS SMEs can position \\nthemselves for growth, innovation and long-term success. These factors, when combined with \\neffective management, enable SMEs to thrive and contribute to the overall economic landscape \\nof Malaysia.To support this adoption, the NIMP 2030 can play a crucial role by providing policy frameworks, \\nincentives as well as funding avenues specifically tailored for SMEs.\\nSafeguard economic security and inclusivity\\nSMEs play a critical role to ensure economic security and inclusivity. SMEs contribute to job \\ncreation, thus providing employment opportunities. Their close connection to surrounding \\ncommunities fosters localised economic development. SMEs that are involved in higher value \\nmanufacturing and services draw higher demand in salary.\\nBusinesses that are established in rural or less developed areas stimulate economic growth in \\nthose areas. The NIMP 2030 provides access to more opportunities for local production from the \\nexpansion to higher value-added activities to the integration into the larger supply chain. \\nThe NIMP 2030 looks to ensure Malaysian businesses, particularly SMEs, are resilient to supply \\nchain disruptions and external economic shocks to ensure long-term sustainability.', metadata={'source': '../a-pdfDocuments\\\\NIMP_2030.pdf', 'page': 166}),\n",

The implementation of the NIMP 2030 emphasises transparency, open communication \\nand collaborative governance. \\nAs Malaysia rallies together, united in purpose, the NIMP 2030 Missions will pave the way for a \\nvibrant future that benefit the Rakyat of Malaysia, particularly by expanding Malaysia’s middle-\\nclass society. The NIMP 2030 Missions will catalyse economic success and social well-being, \\nimproving the quality of life of the people and ensuring a prosperous future for generations to \\ncome.

It allows for more \\nmeaningful comparisons of GDP by considering both the quantity and value of \\ngoods and services.20\\n4 The implemented data is compiled based on the results from a survey \\nconducted by MIDA on the implementation status of projects. Projects that are \\nimplemented are those that are in the production or machinery installation/\\nfactory construction stages, which are used as a proxy measure for realised \\ninvestments. Projects can take one to two years to be implemented depending \\non the project gestation period. The coverage for the survey is projects that were \\napproved under MIDA, which would be those under the manufacturing and \\nselected services sectors. Baseline 2005 figures are the total for 1996-2005 (IMP2 \\nperiod) and breakdown for manufacturing and services across this period is \\nnot available.
