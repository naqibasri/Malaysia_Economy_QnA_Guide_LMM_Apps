It aims to balance the energy trilemma, which involves ensuring energy security, affordability, and environmental sustainability. The pathway includes the following key elements:\\n\\n1. Increased use of renewable energy (RE) in the power generation mix: NETR aims to significantly increase the proportion of RE in the power generation mix to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and promote clean energy sources.\\n\\n2. Phasing out coal from the power generation mix: NETR plans to gradually phase out coal-fired power plants to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality.\\n\\n3. Broad-based energy efficiency initiatives: NETR emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency measures to reduce energy consumption across key sectors, including residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation. This includes optimizing energy usage, improving building efficiency, and promoting energy-efficient appliances and technologies.\\n\\n4. Electrification and biofuels in the transport sector: NETR encourages the shift to electric vehicles and the use of biofuels in the transportation sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable mobility.\\n\\n5. Energy storage and RE intermittency: To address the intermittency of RE sources such as solar and wind, NETR highlights the need for energy storage solutions to ensure a reliable and stable power supply.\\n\\n6. Exploration of non-carbon energy sources: NETR recognizes the potential of non-carbon energy sources, including RE imports through regional interconnectors, to further diversify the energy mix and reduce carbon footprint.\\n\\nOverall, the Energy System Pathway of NETR provides a comprehensive roadmap for Malaysia's energy transition, aiming to create a more sustainable, secure, and affordable energy system for the future.\""
